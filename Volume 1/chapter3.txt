A Waring in the Mist

Outside the gym Legoshi is standing alone guarding the entrance as Louis and Zoe practise their part inside the gym room. Legoshi recalled how he ended up in this situation. Zoe being not able to remember his line properly made Louis irritated. Louis did want to look bad because of Zoeâ€™s poor performance.


Legoshi still outside the gym entrance waiting for their rehearsal to complete. Smell the scent of a herbivore near him. Could not able to figure out the identity his carnivore instincts kicks inside of him. It only took him a couple of seconds to reach his target. Grabbing it from behind who was later to be known as Haru (white rabbit).
